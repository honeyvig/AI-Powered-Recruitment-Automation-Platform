# AI-Powered-Recruitment-Automation-Platform
We are looking for an experienced AI/ML development team to build a state-of-the-art AI recruitment platform for our healthcare staffing business. The system will automate the entire recruitment process by handling job postings, candidate communications, and even AI-driven recruiter calls, with the capability to scale up to 500 virtual recruiters.

Key Responsibilities:

• AI-Powered Job Posting & Matching:
• Develop an AI system to automatically review open job opportunities and post them on job boards (e.g., Indeed, LinkedIn, Vivian).
• Build a candidate-matching engine that analyzes job descriptions and matches candidates from our database of 700 CNAs, ensuring top candidates are identified for each opportunity.
• Automated Communication & Outreach:
• Automate job broadcasts via text messaging and email campaigns, leveraging AI to personalize communications based on candidate profiles and history.
• Integrate AI chatbots for SMS and email responses, managing candidate engagement and answering frequently asked questions.
• AI-Driven Recruiter Calls:
• Implement AI voice assistants to handle repetitive tasks such as calling candidates, conducting basic pre-screenings, and following up on job offers.
• Use machine learning to optimize call scripts and ensure a smooth candidate experience.
• End-to-End Workflow Automation:
• Automate pre-screening, interview scheduling, offer generation, and candidate follow-up processes using Robotic Process Automation (RPA).
• Create an analytics dashboard to track performance, recruitment metrics, and placement outcomes in real-time.
• NLP & Sentiment Analysis:
• Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze responses from candidates via email or SMS, enabling the system to categorize responses and take appropriate actions.
• Use sentiment analysis to prioritize candidates who show high interest.
• Scalability to 500 AI Recruiters:
• Ensure the system is scalable to support up to 500 AI recruiters, utilizing cloud infrastructure like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure to handle increased workloads.

Technical Requirements:

• AI & Machine Learning: Experience with TensorFlow, PyTorch, or similar frameworks to develop job-matching and AI automation features.
• NLP Expertise: Familiarity with spaCy, OpenAI GPT, or IBM Watson for text and voice automation.
• RPA Tools: Experience with UiPath, Blue Prism, or other automation platforms for recruitment workflows.
• Voice Automation: Experience with Twilio, Google Duplex, or Amazon Connect to build AI-driven voice call systems.
• Cloud Infrastructure: Experience with AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for cloud-based AI solutions and scalability.
• API Integration: Ability to integrate with job boards and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) like RingCentral, ADP, and others.

Preferred Experience:

• Previous experience developing AI recruitment platforms or automation tools for staffing companies.
• Familiarity with healthcare staffing or recruiting workflows.
• Experience in building and scaling AI-based systems in the recruitment or HR space.

Deliverables:

• AI-powered recruitment platform capable of automating job postings, candidate outreach, and voice calls.

        "location": "New York",
        "requirements": "CNA certification, 3+ years experience",
    },
    # Add more job postings as needed
]

# 1. AI-Powered Job Matching
def match_candidates_to_jobs(job_description, candidates):
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

    return [{"candidate": match[0], "score": match[1]} for match in matches if match[1] > 0.3]

# 2. Automated Communication via SMS and Email
def send_sms(phone_number, message):

        # Send SMS or Email to Candidate
        send_sms(candidate["phone"], f"New job opportunity: {job['title']} in {job['location']}. Check your email for details.")
        send_email(candidate["email"], "New Job Opportunity", f"Hi {candidate['name']},\n\nWe have a new job opening for {job['title']} in {job['location']}.\n\nBest Regards,\nRecruitment Team")

    return jsonify({"message": "Recruitment workflow executed successfully."})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Key Features of the Code
